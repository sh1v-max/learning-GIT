# What is CLI and GIT?

## CLI (Command Line Interface)

The Command Line Interface (CLI) is a text-based interface for interacting with a computer's operating system. It provides an alternative to using a graphical user interface (GUI) for interacting with the operating system and running applications. The CLI is typically used for tasks that require a high degree of flexibility and automation, such as scripting and batch processing.

## GIT (Global Information Tracker)

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like local branching, staged commits, and multiple workflows.
